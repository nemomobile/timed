Setting Time:

* Manual, by a client application
* Automatic, by NITZ (cellular operator, if available)
* Automatic, by NTP or GPS (not implemented in Harmanttan)

Setting Timezone:

* Manual
* Automatic, by MCC (in countries like FI, DE, India, China)
* Automatic, by MCC + NITZ (in countries like Spain, Russia, most of USA, Canada)
* Half-automatic: by MCC+NITZ and user input (in USA, Canada, Australia)
[last two items are not implemented yet, but are high priority, will be done soon]

Events:

* Single shot events
** at given time at given timezone,
** at given time at current timezone
** at given epoch time (seconds since 1970 UTC)
* Recurrent events
** like every Monday and Wednesday at 12:00
** at given or current timezone
** even more complex: at 14:23, last Friday every month etc
* conditional: if device is connected to internet etc (will be done in Harmattan)

Actions:

* Boot up the device (if off)
* Reminder dialog (libtimed-voland interface)
* Sending D-Bus method/signal
* Execution of a shell command

Interface:

* Native C++ (QtDBus) interface
* Cron-like file in a special format (libiodata library)
* Possible: reading of files in cron format (not planned for Harmattan)

Notifications via D-Bus:

* System time change
* Timezone change
* Settings change (like manual->automatic)

Misc:

* Sane behaviour if system time is lost (by battery fault for example)
* Kernel will notify timed, if some 3rd party is changing system time
